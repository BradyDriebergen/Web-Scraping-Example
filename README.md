# Web-Scraping-Example

Project Idea - Personal Tech Assistant (WIP)

Create a python script that checks the local news, weather, and possibly other
things and displays it to the user. This will use web scraping and API requests
to do it.

Level 1: Script that accesses news site such as google news or yahoo news for 
the top 6 stories. This can be acomplished by using a webscraper to scan for the
first 6 links in the site. The script will then scan all of the <p> text and
summarize it in a few sentences using AI or pytorch. It will display this
information to the user in the terminal.

Level 2: Include other pieces of information such as current weather, current
events, reminders, etc. Refer to Edge's home screen for ideas.

Level 3: Create a UI that opens up when you run the script. It should be closely
related to Edge's home page.
